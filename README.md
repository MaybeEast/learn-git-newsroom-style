# Learn Git Newsroom Style

Hey, gumshoe. You're a reporter now. If you want to make it on this job you've
got to learn our tools. We use Git and GitHub to coordinate what we'll write in
our daily paper every day. You'll need to get together a small staff to coordinate
our next publication.

Well, get to it!

## Assigning Roles

Get in a team. We need someone to report on each of these topics:

* Local News
* Sports
fgsdfg

Once you have been assigned a topic, you should work on contributions and revisions
for only that topic.

## Required Contributions & Revisions
Make sure to create a new branch for each of the contributions/revisions with the
following naming convention:

topics/contribution
eg. "local-news/fix-deli-owner-name-for-cat-tree-article"

* The local news story about the cat stuck in a tree has an error. The name was
completely wrong. Change all instances of "Sam Cowell" to "Henry Berringer."
* Write a local news column about the cat show going on at city center. It's
called "Paws at the Pumpkin Patch." Remind people there's another one coming up
in February called "My Furry Valentine."
* Update the final score of the high school basketball game to 93-78. Moonauts
beat the Crows.
* Who put the board game story under sports? Move it to culture!

For each contribution/revision performed, also make sure to update it onto the
headlines of the front page!

# Publishing
Once you are done with the contribution/revision, make a pull request from your branch
to the master branch and wait for it to be checked and merged in.
